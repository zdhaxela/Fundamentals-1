# key concepts in c++ programing

namespaces - help organize code, prevent naming conflicts, and avoid confusion
`
#include <iostream> 
`

 library, which is necessary for input/output operations (like printing to the console)


`intmain` ()
- start of the main function.

`int`

- indicates that the main function returns an integer value
`main`

- special function name that marks the beginning of your program's execution. The operating system looks for this function when it starts your program


`return 0`;
 - This line indicates that the program has executed successfully and returns the value 0 to the operating system.
- Non-zero values often indicate an error

`using namespace std;`:

- This statement allows you to use elements from the std namespace (like cout, cin, endl) without the std:: prefix, making your code more concise

`cin`	- Standard input stream 
`cout` - Standard output stream 

####  # different types of variables in C++ -


- `int` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
- `double` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
- `char` - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by - single quotes
- `string` - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
- `bool` - stores values with two states: true or false
